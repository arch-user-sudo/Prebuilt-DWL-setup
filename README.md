             * Copy The Folders In CONFIG to your .config folder for mako, & rofi theme.

             * I'll upload the fastfetch config soon.

             * I'm Lazy, I'll keep this repo up to date over time. 

             * My setup supports the hardened Linux Kernel aswell. check the keybinds in config.h in dwl folder. 

             * To close a window, Turn on Caps Lock, Then Press SUPER + SHIFT + Q with your mouse hovered over the 
             selected window that you wanna close, I made it this way so its nearly impossible to close something accidentaly. 

             * There are some missing keybind errors that pop up when compiling, dont worry about that. 
             If you wanna add one of the features, you can find it in config.def.h.


             * I'm Lazy, I'll keep this repo up to date over time. dw about the long term, i use this for myself so it'll always 
             get maintained
